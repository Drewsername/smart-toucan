## Development Principles

- ‚úÖ **Imperative logic** with strong **object-oriented design**
- ‚úÖ Each file < 100 lines, **single-responsibility**
- ‚úÖ **Managers** encapsulate business logic, inheriting shared behavior
- ‚úÖ Prisma used declaratively; Python logic kept fully **explicit & traceable**
- ‚úÖ Easy to navigate, extend, and reason about with minimal context
